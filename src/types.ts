   * In this representation of Modern Monetary Theory, there are two variables
   * to consider. The first is `taxes`, and the second is `income` (an ironic
   * name, given that it's not really the `government`'s `income`, but we'll see
   * as the explanation unfolds).
   *
   * Think of the `squares` as people. The idea is that people (`squares`) like
   * money, so we decide that it's the `government`'s job to supply `squares`
   * with money. It so happens periodically in the form of `income`, which the
   * `squares` then use, rapidly, and make the apparent amount of money in
   * circulation (and therefore the amount of money) higher. However, This leads
   * to inflation, so it's also the `government`'s job to counteract it. It does
   * this by taking money away from the people in the form of taxes. Keeping
   * both in balance is the whole point of the game!
